# BattleBots-Autonomy-v1

BattleBots is a televised American combat robot competition that is [hopefully] going to enter it's 9th season soon. While no official announcements have been made, our team is taking on an exceptionally difficult challenge of trying to automate the control of our robot, and are thus starting work on it extra early. 

## BattleBots Fundamentals

If you're familiar with the sport, feel free to skip this section. If you're not, I recommend taking the time to familiarize yourself with the BattleBots rules, as they dictate a lot of our design decisions. 

A standard BattleBot fight consists of two teams fighting their robotic machines in a 3-minute battle. While most teams bring 1 robot to the fight, some exercise their right to bring multiple bots, as long as their total weights sum to 250lbs. Each teams' robot(s) start in their coloured square (red/blue) on opposing sides of the arena. Then, once the three-minute timer starts counting down, the robots fight!

The match continues with both robots trying to defeat each other. Ideally, your robot is able to immobilize the opponent's robot or even knock it out of the arena.

The BattleBots [tournament rules](https://battlebots.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BattleBots-Tournament-Rules.2018.Rev-1.01.pdf) and [design rules](https://battlebots.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BattleBots-Design-Rules.Rev-2018.0.pdf) provide further details, for anyone interested.
